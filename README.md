| **Shift + ctrl** | Not allowed |
| **Shift + alt** | "&A" |
| **Shift + supr** | "@A" |
| **Shift + ctrl + alt** | "&^A" |

> Ctrl without supr dont allow lowercase chars

## Potential issues + todos

- **Potential issue: CTRL + lowercase is read as ctrl + upercase and ctrl + shift cant be read**
- CTRL is too limited
- CTRL + SHIFT + KEY: crash
- CTRL + 1,9,0 dont exists
- right + left + down at the same time breaks the handler. with -O3 it doesnt happened xd
